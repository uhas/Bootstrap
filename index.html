As she’s running through the hallway, the door to the cupboard under the stairs opens, and a hand reaches out and pulls her in.
                It’s her mother.
                She whispers to her child, “Don’t go into the kitchen. I heard it too.”.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Mommy told me never to go in the basement, but I wanted to see what was making that noise. It kind of sounded like a puppy, and I wanted to see the puppy, so I opened the basement door and tiptoed down a bit. I didn’t see a puppy, and then Mommy yanked me out of the basement and yelled at me. Mommy had never yelled at me before, and it made me sad and I cried. Then Mommy told me never to go into the basement again, and she gave me a cookie. That made me feel better, so I didn’t ask her why the boy in the basement was making noises like a puppy, or why he had no hands or feet.</p>
